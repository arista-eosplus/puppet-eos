Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_switchconfig) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    Manage the complete EOS config as a file

    Use files, templates, or concatenated files/template blocks to build
    and manage the entire EOS configuration as a single object.  By default,
    changes will be written to flash:startup-config then the 'configure
    replace' in EOS will safely overwrite the running-config.

    Examples:

        eos_switchconfig { 'running-config':
          source  => template(),
        }

        eos_switchconfig { 'running-config':
          content => template(),
        }


        eos_switchconfig { 'running-config':
          source  => template(),
          file    => 'config-puppet',
        }
  EOS
