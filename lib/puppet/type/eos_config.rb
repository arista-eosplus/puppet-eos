Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_config) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    Apply arbitrary configuration commands to Arista EOS.  Commands will only
    be applied based on the matching a regular expression, if supplied. If the
    command is not already present, within the given section, if provided,
    eos_config will configure the node using the supplied command.

    Examples:

        eos_config { 'Set location':
          command => 'snmp-server location Here',
        }

        # Only manage the description if an description exists
        eos_config { 'Set interface description':
          section => 'interface Ethernet1',
          command => 'description My Description',
          regexp  => 'description [A-z]',
        }
  EOS

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name, namevar: true) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name parameter is the name associated with the resource.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      unless value.is_a? String
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end

        fail "Required property 'command' is missing."
      end
    end
  end

  newparam(:section) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Restricts the configuration evaluation to a single configuration
      section.  If the configuration section argument is not provided,
      then the global configuration is used.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      case value
      when String
        super(value)
      else fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end
    end
  end

  newparam(:regexp) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Specifies the regular expression to use to evaluate the current nodes
      running configuration.  This optional argument will default to use the
      command argument if none is provided.

      when String
        super(value)

      end
    end
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:command) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Specifies the configuration command to send to the node if the
      regexp does not evalute to true.
