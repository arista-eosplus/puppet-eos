Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_config) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    Apply arbitrary configuration commands in Arista EOS.  Commands will only be applied based on the absence or presence of regular expression matches.
    configuration for a specific command.  If the command are either
    present or absent, the eos_config will configure the node using
    the command argument.

    Example:

        eos_config { 'Shut interface':
          command => 'shutdown',
          section => 'interface Ethernet1',
          regexp  => '',
        }
  EOS

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name parameter is the name associated with the resource.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      unless value.is_a? String
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end
    end
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:command) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Specifies the configuration command to send to the node if the
      regexp does not evalute to true.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      case value
      when String
        super(value)
        validate_features_per_value(value)
      else fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:section) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Restricts the configuration evaluation to a single configuration
      section.  If the configuration section argument is not provided,
      then the global configuration is used.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      case value
      when String
        super(value)
        validate_features_per_value(value)
      else fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:regexp) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Specifies the regular expression to use to evaluate the current nodes
      running configuration.  This optional argument will default to use the
      command argument if none is provided.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      case value
      when String
        super(value)
        validate_features_per_value(value)
      else fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
