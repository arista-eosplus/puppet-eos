Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_acl_entry) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    Manage access-lists on Arista EOS.

    Example:

        eos_acl_entry{ 'test1:10':
          ensure       => present,
          acltype      => standard,
          action       => permit,
          srcaddr      => '1.2.3.0',
          srcprefixlen => 8,
          log          => true,
        }

        eos_acl_entry{ 'test1:12':
          ensure       => present,
          acltype      => standard,
          action       => remark,
          remark       => 'This leaves a mark',
        }

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name parameter is a composite namevar that combines the
      access-list name and the sequence number delimited by the
      colon (:) character

      For example, if the access-list name is foo and the sequence
      number for this rule is 10 the namvar would be constructed as
      "foo:10"

      The composite namevar is required to uniquely identify the
      specific list and rule to configure
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      fail "value #{value.inspect} must contain a colon" unless value =~ /:/
    end
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:acltype) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The ACL type which is either standard and extended. Standard ACLs
      filter only on the source IP address. Extended ACLs allow
      specification of source and destination IP addresses.
    EOS
    newvalues(:standard, :extended)
  end

  newproperty(:action) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The action for the rule can be permit, deny, or remark. Deny is the
      default value. Packets filtered by a permit rule are accepted by
      interfaces to which the ACL is applied. Packets filtered by a
      deny rule are dropped by interfaces to which the ACL is applied.
      Remark leaves a comment within the access-list.
    EOS
    newvalues(:permit, :deny, :remark)
  end

  newproperty(:remark) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Remark to insert in the access-list.  Must be used with the
      'remark' action.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      unless value.is_a? String
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."

        unless @shouldorig.is_a? String
          fail "value #{@shouldorig.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
        end
      end
      unless @resource[:action] == :remark
        fail "Remark property is only valid when 'action => remark'"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:srcaddr) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The source IP address. The following options are supported:

      network_address - subnet address where srcprefixlen defines mask
      any             - Packets from all addresses are filtered.
      host ip_addr    - IP address (dotted decimal notation)
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      w = value.split
      unless value =~ IPADDR_REGEXP || value =~ /^any$/ ||
             (w.length == 2 && w[0].eql?('host') && w[1] =~ IPADDR_REGEXP)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a network " \
             "address, 'any', or 'host IP address'"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:srcprefixlen) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The source address prefix len used when srcaddr is a network address
      to define the subnet. Values range from 0 to 32.
    EOS

    munge { |value| Integer(value) }

    validate do |value|
      unless value.to_i.between?(0, 32)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} must be between 0 and 32"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:log, boolean: false) do
    desc <<-EOS
      When set to true, triggers an informational log message to the
      console about hte matching packet.
    EOS
    newvalues(:true, :false)
  end
