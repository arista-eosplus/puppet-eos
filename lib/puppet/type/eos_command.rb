  @doc = <<-EOS
    Execute arbitrary CLI commands on Arista EOS. Commands can be executed
    in priviledged mode (enable) or configuration commands.

        eos_command { 'Save running-config':
          mode     => 'enable',
          commands => 'copy running-config startup-config',
        }
  EOS

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS

    EOS
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:mode) do
    desc <<-EOS
      Specifies the command mode to execute the commands in. If this
      value is config then the command list is executed in config mode.
      If the value is enable, then the command list is executed in
      privileged (enable) mode. The default is enable mode.

    newvalues(:enable, :config)
  end

  newproperty(:commands, array_matching: :all) do
