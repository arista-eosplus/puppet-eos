Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_interface) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    Manage common attributes of all Arista EOS interfaces.

    Example:

        eos_interface { 'Management1':
          enable        => true,
          description   => 'OOB management to mgmt-sw1 Ethernet42',
        }
        eos_interface { 'Ethernet1.10':
          enable        => true,
          encapsulation => '10',
        }

  # Parameters
  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name parameter specifies the full interface identifier of
      the Arista EOS interface to manage.  This value must correspond
      to a valid interface identifier in EOS.
    EOS
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:description) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The one line description to configure for the interface.  The
      description can be any valid alphanumeric string including symbols
      and spaces.
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      case value
      when String then super(value)
      else fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a String."
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:encapsulation) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The vlan ID to use in encapsulation dot1q vlab configurations for sub interfaces.
    EOS
    munge { |value| Integer(value).to_s }

    validate do |value|
      unless value.to_i.between?(1, 4_094)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is not between 1 and 4094"
      end

  end

  newproperty(:load_interval) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The load interval of an interface.
    EOS
    munge { |value| Integer(value).to_s }
    validate do |value|
      unless value.to_i.between?(5, 600)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} must be between 5 and 600"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:enable) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The enable value configures the administrative state of the
      specified interface.   Valid values for enable are:

      * true - Administratively enables the interface
      * false - Administratively disables the interface
