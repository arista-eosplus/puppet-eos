Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_ipinterface) do
  @doc = <<-EOS
    This type provides management of logical IP interfaces configured
    in EOS.  It provides configuration of IPv4 properties on physical
    interfaces and logical virtual interfaces.
  EOS

  ensurable

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name parameter specifies the full interface identifier of
      the Arista EOS interface to manage.  This value must correspond
      to a valid interface identifier in EOS.
    EOS
  end

  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:address) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The address property configures the IPv4 address on the
      specified interface.  The address value is configured using
      address/mask format.

      For example

        address => 192.168.10.16/24
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      begin
        IPAddr.new value
      rescue ArgumentError => exc
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, #{exc.message}"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:helper_addresses, array_matching: :all) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The helper_addresses property configures the list of IP
      helper addresses on the specified interface.  IP helper
      addresses configure a list of forwarding address to send
      send broadcast traffic to as unicast, typically used to
      assist DHCP relay.

      Helper addresses are configured using dotted decimal
      notation.  For example

        helper_addresses => ['192.168.10.254', '192.168.11.254']
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      unless value =~ IPADDR_REGEXP
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be an IP address"
      end
    end
  end

  newproperty(:mtu) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The mtu property configures the IP interface MTU value
      which specifies the largest IP datagram that can pass
      over the interface without fragementation.  The MTU value
      is specified in bytes and accepts an integer in the range of
      68 to 9214.
    EOS

    munge do |value|
      Integer(value)
    end

    validate do |value|
      unless value.to_i.between?(68, 9214)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} must be in the range of 68 and 9214"
      end
    end
  end
end
