Puppet::Type.newtype(:eos_mlag_interface) do

  @doc = <<-EOS
    This type manages MLAG interfaces on the node used to establish
    a valid MLAG with a peer switch.  The mlag_id parameter is required
    for this type.

  # Parameters

  newparam(:name) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The name property identifies the interface to be present
      or absent from the MLAG interface list.  The interface must
      be of type portchannel.

      This property expectes the full interface identifier
    EOS

    validate do |value|
      unless value =~ /^Port-Channel/
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is invalid, must be a Port-Channel"
      end
    end
  end


  # Properties (state management)

  newproperty(:mlag_id) do
    desc <<-EOS
      The mlag_id property assigns a MLAG ID to a Port-Channel interface
      used for forming a MLAG with a peer switch.  Only one MLAG ID can
      be associated with an interface.

      Valid values are in the range of 1 to 2000

      **Note**
      Changing this value on an operational link will cause traffic
      distruption
    EOS

    munge do |value|
      Integer(value).to_i
    end

    validate do |value|
      unless value.to_i.between?(1, 2_000)
        fail "value #{value.inspect} is not between 1 and 2000"
