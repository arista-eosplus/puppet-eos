## Overview

The Arista EOS module for Puppet provides a set of types and providers for
automating Arista EOS node configuraitons.  The module allows for configuration
of EOS nodes using the Puppet agent running native in EOS.

The Puppet EOS modules are freely provided to the open source community for
automating Arista EOS node configurations using Puppet.  Support for the
modules is provided on a best effort basis by the Arista EOS+ community.
Please file any bugs, questions or enhancement requests using [Github
Issues](http://github.com/arista-eosplus/puppet-eos/issues)

## Module Description

This module provides network abstractions for configuring network services on
Arista EOS nodes.  The module provides a set of types and providers to serve as
building blocks for automating the configuration of Arista EOS nodes.  This
module extends Puppet's capability to configure network devices including node
system services, access services and trunk side services of EOS nodes running
EOS 4.13 or later with the Puppet agent installed.  The Puppet agent running on
the node will use pluginsync to download the types and providers from the Puppet
master and uses the Ruby Client for eAPI (rbeapi) to interface with the nodes
configuration.

## Setup

### What Puppet EOS affects

The types and providers in this module provide native abstractions for
configuring Arista EOS nodes.

### Setup Requirements

This module requires pluginsync in order to synchronize the types and providers
to the node.  This module also requires the [Ruby Client for eAPI](rbeapi) to
be installed on the master and nodes.

### Beginning with eos

 1. Install the module on the Puppet master
 2. Install the rbeapi gem on the Puppet master [See Ruby Client for eAPI](rbeapi)
 3. Install the rbeapi gem on the switch [See Ruby Client for eAPI](rbeapi)
 4. Run the puppet agent on the switch to synchronize the types and providers
 5. List the types by running `bash sudo puppet resource --types | grep eos`
    from the EOS CLI enable mode
 6. Verify the providrs by running `bash sudo puppet resource <resource>` from 
    the EOS CLI enable mode

```
Arista$ bash sudo puppet resource eos_vlan
eos_vlan { '1':
  ensure    => 'present',
  enable    => 'true',
  vlan_name => 'default',
}
eos_vlan { '100':
  ensure    => 'present',
  enable    => 'true',
  vlan_name => 'TEST_VLAN_100',
}
```

## Usage

See the [Documentation](http://puppet-eos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## Reference

See the [Type reverence](http://puppet-eos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/types.html) in the documentation

## Limitations
* Puppet 3.6 or later
* Ruby 1.9.3 or later
* [Arista EOS 4.13.7M or later](arista)
* [Ruby Client for eAPI 0.1.0 or later](rbeapi)

## Development

This module can be configured to run directly from source and configured to do
local development, sending the commands to the node over HTTP.  The following
instructions explain how to configure your local development environment.

This module requires one dependency that must be checked out as a Git working
copy in the context of ongoing development in addition to running Puppet from
source.

 * [rbeapi][rbeapi]

The dependency is managed via the bundler Gemfile and the environment needs to
be configured to use local Git copies:

    cd /workspace
    git clone https://github.com/arista-eosplus/rbeapi
    export GEM_RBEAPI_VERSION=file:///workspace/rbeapi

Once the dependencies are installed and the environment configured, then
install all of the dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/arista-eosplus/puppet-eos
    cd puppet-eos
    bundle install --path .bundle/gems

Once everything is installed, run the spec tests to make sure everything is
working properly:

    bundle exec rspec spec

Finally, configure the eapi.conf file for rbeapi [See rbeapi for
details][rbeapi] and set the connection enviroment variable to run sanity tests
using `puppet resource`:

    export RBEAPI_CONNECTION=veos01
